0.  TODO is an English word that refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis. "An artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust."
1.  TODO Required when need to know the usage of system data and runtime of process. 
2.  TODO 16
3.  TODO Maybe because it required less resources 
4.  TODO Writes every character except digits into an array, increasing also the words counter. 
         If the character is '\n' and is not first on the line, also writes it. 
         If the counter of characters is more than its length, then programm will skip everything until new word's character is found, reseting index.
         If the counter of characters is more than zero, but the new character is neither digit nor alphabetical, it means end of word. '\0' is added and words++.
         Then the whole word is checked via check(). Data about the usage is stored.If check returned false, then misspeled word counter is increased and printed.
         Index is reset to zero. The loop starts again.
5.  TODO A lot more difficult to check each character creating complete "words". Inconsistency and problems with different data types: digits, escape-ch etc.
6.  TODO Files inside of directory should not be changed and must stay the same throught the whole run of a programm.
